Configuring Dovecot to provide LMTP to be able to use SIEVE

   This short manual is an addendum to the 'dovecot.txt' guide that
   will detail how to enable 'Local Mail Transport Protocol', aka LMTP
   on a typical Dovecot-server. It has been tested under Debian 8.0 (Jessie)
   and 9.0 (Stretch) using Dovecot 2.2.27

   The main reason you'd want to have LMTP support is because it enables
   (v)exim to deliver mail 'through' Dovecot and use it's Sieve-capabilities
   to do server-side filtering of incoming mail.

   It is beyond the scope of this guide to explain all that can be done using
   sieve, or how to write filters. Please see SIEVE chapter of the "README.md"
   file for links to places that explain this in more detail.

1. In the 'dovecot.txt' file it was already explained just which parts are
   required for basic operation of dovecot as an IMAP server with SQL-lookups.
   Due to the modular nature of dovecot, extra functionality is provided
   through installing extra components and completing configuration for them.

   The required components for lmtp and sieve are:
    - dovecot-lmtpd    		# The LMTP protocol handler
    - dovecot-sieve    		# Enables running mail through SIEVE filters
    - dovecot-managesieved 	# Runs a daemon on port 4190 for altering filters

   To install these components under debian, use:

   # apt-get install dovecot-sieve dovecot-lmtpd dovecot-managesieved

2. A few pieces of extra configuration are required at this point to get things
   working. Note that the settings below correspond to what's required to get
   LMTP/SIEVE working with the vexim-lmtp variant as provided in the
   'debian.conf.d/mysql-lmtp' and 'debian.conf.d/pgsql-lmtp' variants
   shipped with vexim2. 

 2.1 In file '/etc/dovecot/conf.d/15-lda.conf', alter the section at the bottom:

   protocol lda {
	mail_plugins = $mail_plugins sieve
   }

 2.2 In file '/etc/dovecot/conf.d/20-lmtp.conf', alter the section at the bottom:

  protocol lmtp {
    mail_plugins = $mail_plugins sieve
    #info_log_path = /var/log/dovecot-lmtp.log
  }	

  You can uncomment the 'info_log_path' to enable logging lmtp deliveries but
  you'll also need to uncomment the 'executeable = lmtp -L' line in the
  '10-master.conf' file as described below.

 2.3 In file '/etc/dovecot/conf.d/90-sieve.conf', there is just one alterations
  suggested, but they depend on just what sieve extensions you might want
  enabled too. The 'editheader' extension is too essential to not 

  sieve_extensions = +editheader

 2.4 In file '/etc/dovecot/conf.d/20-managesieve.conf', we need to only uncomment
  the top line in the file:

  protocols = $protocols sieve

 2.5 In file '/etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-mail.conf', there is a minor edit
  required to properly get dovecot+sieve to understand that a '/' is a
  valid character in a mailbox-path, and that it should be seen as a 
  separator; to support 'subfolders' (aka directories of mailfolders.
  like 'private/bank' 'private/family','work/human_resources','work/it_dept'
  etc). Without this, any mail-filters that try to put mail into a mailbox
  inside a folder will seem not to work. In debug-logs (see end of this text)
  you will find 'Invalid mailbox name: Name must not have '/' characters.'

  In the section 'namespace inbox {', set the separator correctly:

  separator = /

 2.6 Finally, in tile '/etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-master.conf', we get to tie
  everything together.

  Most likely, there is already a section for lmtp that enables the
  LMTP-service over a unix-style socket (instead of TCPIP), which is
  the manner in which we connect to it in (v)exim. However
  I will list a complete section here for reference, also because you
  will require an extra statement in case you chose to log lmtp-traffic
  in '20-lmtp.conf'. Uncomment the 'executable' line, if so. You can
  safely ignore all the #'ed lines and not copy them over, as long
  as you DO include the } at the bottom, of course:

  service lmtp {
    #executable = lmtp -L
    unix_listener lmtp {
      #mode = 0666
    }

    # Create inet listener only if you can't use the above UNIX socket
    #inet_listener lmtp {
      # Avoid making LMTP visible for the entire internet
      #address =
      #port =
    #}
  }
 
  That's it for config-file alterations! Phew!
  
3 ***** IMPORTANT ****
  Dovecot's LMTP delivery program gets called by the user 'Debian-exim' and thus the permissions of the /var/vmail
  directory no longer are sufficient. A suggestion is to change the group of the /var/vmail dir to 'Debian-exim' and
  set g+rw on it.
  
  chown vexim:Debian-exim /var/vmail
  chmod g+rw /var/vmail


  Failure to do this will result in weird errors, with the mail being accepted by exim, but no local files stored
  for pop/imap accounts.

4 You can now restart Dovecot and it should not complain about anything
  If so, please review if you made the changes above correctly and/or
  follow up any warnings given by doing some online search-work on
  the errors given.

5 To start using sieve, please use a sieve-capable mail-client
  (like Thunderbird or even Roundcube), and set up a simple filter
  to test lmtp/sieve functionality working properly.
  By using a mail-client to set the filter, you will also be
  testing wether the 'dovecot-managesieved' is working properly.

  A simple sieve-file with one filter that'll work with the settings and
  options enabled above could look something like this:

  require ["fileinto", "reject", "regex", "variables","mailbox"];

  if header :contains ["subject"] ["veximtest"]
  {
    fileinto :create "testdirectory/testfolder";
    stop;
  }


  This filter would check for mails with a subject that contains the
  word 'veximtest' in the subject and stuff it into the mailbox
  'testdirectory/testfolder', which it would create if it doesnt exist
  already.
  Note that a lot of mail-clients do not automatically 'see' or 'notice'
  newly created folders that were not created by themselves. In
  thunderbird, you will need to 'subscribe' to the folder to see it in
  the side-panel, first. You can unset the 'Show Only Subscribed Folders'
  checkbox in the 'account settings->server settings->'advanced' button


6 Debugging can be done through checking the /var/log/dovecot-sieve.log
  file's contents. Next to that, the sieve-server also creates per-user
  log entries and refers to them in the /var/log/dovecot-sieve.log file.

  In the case of our vexim settings, these would be found in:

  /var/vmail/<domainname>/<username>/.dovecot.sieve.log

 Note the '.' at the beginning of that filename; it's a hidden file by
 design.
